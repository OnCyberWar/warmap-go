# warmap-go

Warmap takes a Kismet gpsxml, Aerodump gps file or Kismet Database file and a set of BSSIDs and creates a polygon of coordinates using the convex hull algorithm. This polygon is overlayed over a Google Maps generated map to show the coverage area of the specified BSSID. In addition, a heatmap is produced which indicates the intensity of the signal strength at all discovered points.

## Usage: ##
```
go run warmap -f [Kismet gpsxml or Aerodump gps file or Kismet Database file] -a [boolean switch if youre using Aerodump output] -k [boolean switch if youre using Kismet Database] -b [File of Comma-seperated List of BSSIDs] -o [HTML output file] -api [Google Maps API Key]
```
Go [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to get a Google Maps API key. warmap-go leverages Google's Maps JavaScript API.
